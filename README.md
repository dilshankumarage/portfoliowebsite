# portfoliowebsite
This is a portfolio website I designed using WordPress. It was my first WordPress website, and I used the OceanWP theme to develop it. Through this project, I mastered the use of elements, structuring web content, and making a website user-friendly and visually appealing. I also learned how to integrate forms and email functionality into the website.
